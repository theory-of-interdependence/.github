# Theory of Interdependence
The Theory of Interdependence is a theory describing the interconnectedness of everything perceivable by human beings in the universe. It is abstracted away from direct human experiences to the greatest extent possible. Refinement over time will be toward further abstraction. It is intended to be a central root theory through which a variety of additional linked theories connect.
